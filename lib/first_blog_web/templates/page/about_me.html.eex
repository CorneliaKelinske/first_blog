       <div class="block">My name is Cornelia Kelinske.</div>

       <div class="block">Instead of listing all the things that I am and obssessing over what to put first, I will use a chronological approach,
       showing how my interests and passions over time have led me to where I am at now.</div>

       <div class="block">I grew up in a small town close to <b>Nuremberg</b>, Germany, home to the best Bratwurst. From an early age, I have been fascinated with foreign languages, which is why I opted
       to learn English, Latin and French in Middle and High School. After graduating from High School, I decided to pursue my passion for languages and
       since I had zero interest in becoming a teacher, I decided to become a conference interpreter instead. Off to university I went, namely to the -- at least in
       the interpreting and translating world -- renowned Faculty of Translation Studies, Linguistics and Cultural Studies of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in <b>Germersheim</b>.
       The highlight of my university years was the opportunity to study as an exchange student. First, I spent six months in <b>Dijon</b>, France, the home of Dijon mustard and cr√®me de cassis where
       I devoured my fair share (or maybe more) of croissants and pain au chocolat. My second semester abroad was at the University of Salford, right next to <b>Manchester</b>. I had the time
       of my life. Fell in love with Manchester, spent many nights out dancing in Fifth Ave and met one of my best friends.</div>

       <div class="block">I graduated as a Diplom-Dolmetscher (German equivalent to a M.A. in conference interpreting) for German, English and French in 2008. Immediately after graduating,
       I accepted a position as a translator and occassional interpreter with the Federal Office of Languages, the language service of the German military. </div>

I am currently working on my own Phoenix app that allows users to upload their image and video files in order to
show them to others. A fun little project that, per se, is nothing crazy or new. I was able to use *Programming Phoenix 1.4* by Chris McCord, Bruce Tate and Jos√© Valim as a great reference to get me started and then there are numerous other resources online. However, when it came to the actual file upload and display part of my project, I found that in most cases files are either not uploaded, but linked to via hyperlink in the template, or files are uploaded into the cloud storage space provided by a third party, like Amazon.

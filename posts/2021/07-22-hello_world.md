My coding journey began with....  

                                
# a friendly "Hello World"


... printed in Python way back in 2018. My husband, who at that time worked as an HVAC mechanic, had just discovered coding for himself and
challenged me to try it as well. What can I say? I am very competitive and at some point said jokingly that one day I would be better at it than him.
(While I have certainly not lived up to that challenge in general, I can say that I at least got better at Python than him, simply due to my stubbornness, which
kept me coding in Python for a long time, while my husband quickly moved on to Ruby and then Elixir.)
At first, the reason why I enjoyed coding was not so much the fact that I could use my code to actually do stuff (because, to be honest, I really didn't), 
but the pure problem-solving aspect of it. 


For the next few years, I kept coding on the back-burner. I tried to fit a short session in every day, but my translation business was thriving and I didn't have any
real coding goals or projects. I completed the Complete Python Bootcamp on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), taught by Colt Steele, an amazing teacher (check out his YouTube
channel: (https://www.youtube.com/c/ColtSteeleCode) and I kept solving the exercises on the [exercism](https://exercism.io/), but at that time, my relationship to code was certainly lacking passion.




What the heckenbob?!




I will also mention my MRV calculator.

Start coding

You are curious about this coding thing, but you don't know how to start or if it is really for you?
Here are a **six** tips for you.

# 1. Find free resources online  


Even just a quick online search will reveal numerous free offers in all kinds of formats that allow you to dip your toes into coding.
I recommend choosing a resource with a practical approach including an online code editor so that you can write code from the get-go without the 
need to install anything on your computer.

I started on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), but [exercism](https://exercism.io/) recently also launched a new version that focuses more on
teaching code and includes concept-based learning exercises and an online code editor.

A good resource for learning more about front-end web development (i.e. creating websites and making them look pretty, to put it very simply) is the **Colt's Code Camp** video series on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF_Xl5TOGlY&t=2320s) by Colt Steele (one of my favorite teachers).

If you already have a specific language in mind, go for it. Otherwise, choosing a popular language such as Python or Ruby is a
good idea, since the more popular the language, the more (beginner-friendly) resources there will be available. Yet, ultimately, I think which programming language
you learn at this very early stage is not that important, since all languages will give you an idea of fundamental coding concepts. Just have fun with it! And don't feel committed to whichever language you started on. You can always switch to a different one or try out a few.


# 2. Dive deeper


Once you have been playing around a bit and found a language you like, it's time to dive deeper. Find more language-specific resources. You might want to start reading
a book on your language (sometimes there are free versions available online), or consider taking a language-specific course or bootcamp. If you do an online search you might
be able to find free or paid courses for your language. One good (paid) option is the [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) platform where they offer courses for many different languages (they often have good sales so if you have a course in mind, but still have other things to work with, it may be worth it to wait for a promotion to come along).

If you haven't done so already: start solving the exercises on [exercism](https://exercism.io/). No better way to learn than to write code.  



# 3. Set up your own workspace  


Install the language(s) you want to work with on your computer and get a code editor. I am using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and have never had any problems with it. Another good idea at this point is to set up a profile on [github](github.com) and to push your code into online github repositories.  


# 4. Check out the other end

If you decide that "YES" writing code is for you and you start playing with the idea of becoming a web developer you will have to put in some thought into what kind of
developer you want to be. Backend (what's under the hood), front-end (the pretty websites visible to the work) or full-stack (both combined). I therefore recommend checking out
a language from the other end. So if you have been working with let's say Python up until this point, go ahead and try your hand at some CSS.

# 5. Find a project to work on

# 6. Immerse yourself in the culture

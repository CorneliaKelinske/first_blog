# 1. Set a positive goal  


Find something positive that you can focus on and work towards instead of working out for negative reasons.
I mean, yes, realistically we often start to work out because we are unhappy with our body and our appearance.
But just try it! Instead of saying: "Oh, I really need to start exercising. I need to loose those extra pounds!", say:
"I want to start exercising because I want to be strong AF and look good naked", or maybe more moderate options such as:
"I want to get into shape so I can go for long bike rides with my kid/play soccer with my kid/go for hikes with my family etc." You see, the first statement makes you focus on the negative stuff, potentially causing you to feel bad before you even get started,
while the positive goals put you into an upbeat mindset where the focus is on the future you, who has already achieved the goal.  


# 2. Find an activity that works for you


Start lifting weights! Strength training is for everyone! Apologies, but I am obviously biased and very passionate about lifting.
But back to being serious: put some thought into what YOU want to do. Don't just go with whatever your friends suggest or with whatever seems the easiest.
If you are lacking rhythm and coordination, that Zumba class your friend wants to drag you to might not be the right choice for you (for me, it would be my personal hell).
If you know that you hate being out in the cold and rain but live in a cold and rainy place, bear that in mind before you commit to outdoor running. 
You can also give yourself some time to try out different things. Just make sure you put a deadline on the trial phase so you don't end up activity hopping forever.  


# 3. Be realistic about your time commitment    


It's easy to over-commit, especially when you are excited about making all these good changes happen. But be realistic about how much time you can dedicate to exercising.
While sometimes finding time is a matter of priorities and making time, there are obligations that you cannot ditch. If you know that you have a full schedule, maybe don't sign up for a program that demands you to go to the gym six times a week for several hours. I think it is better to exercise fewer times, yet consistently, than missing workouts or classes. In the first scenario, you are successfully sticking to a routine and have nothing to feel bad about. In the second scenario, you are not meeting your goals and probably feel bad about it and about yourself. That is not a good place to be in. That is the place where you feel like you fell off the wagon and all of a sudden climbing on feels so hard.


# 4. Be realistic about your fitness level


This piece of advice goes both ways. Don't overestimate yourself but don't underestimate yourself either.
You don't need to run a marathon the first time you go running. You don't need to do a double-bodyweight squat the first time you enter the gym.
Start small, build up, be smart, don't get injured.
On the other hand, though: don't be afraid to try. If you can't do something right away, find a way to build up to it or to work around it. You can't squat the barbell? Try
a goblet squat. You can't run the 5 k? No problem, run 2, or alternate between running and walking. Can't do the headstand? Dolphin pose is here for you.  


# 5. Find a program and stick with it  


This tip probably applies first of all if you are choosing to start some kind of strength training. Sure, there are tons of workout videos on the Internet, but, ultimately, 
you will want something that allows you to track your progress in order to ensure that you keep stimulating your muscles (the buzzword is: progressive overload). Using a good program also means that you will always be prepared when it is time to exercise. You won't waste precious minutes wondering what exercise you should do next. If you have found something that appeals to you, make sure to stick with it for a couple of months. Good strength training programs often focus on long-term results and you might not be able to reap the fruits of your labor after a couple of weeks. 
But even if you are choosing something other than strength training, it might still be worth it to sign up for a program, or a club or classes. It can be easier to stick to a routine if you either paid for it or are doing the activity as part of a group. 


# 6. Be realistic about your efforts


You wonder what I mean? Well, to put it very bluntly: you cannot outrun a doughnut and, no, bro, it's not all muscle.
I am not saying that you need to go on a diet or that weight loss should be your goal. I am including this tip because overestimating my workout efforts has tripped me up more than once. I started running, but then I started treating myself to more chocolate, more cocktails, more beer (that would have been during my student years).
I started lifting and ate all those really great burgers with bacon and guac and Swiss cheese on the way back from the gym. Because protein. I went to Hot Yoga and got Quiznos for dinner on the way home. And surprise, surprise, despite the work that I put into my workouts, I did not see the physical changes I was hoping for. Again, I am not saying that you should never have treats, but just be aware that adding more treats because you are exercising has the potential to backfire. As I said: been there, done that.  


# 7. The others are not even there  


You are doing this for yourself. There is no need to compare yourself to others, to worry about them or to listen to them (at least most of the time). 

Yes, you are very likely not the best at whatever activity you chose.
Yes, that girl over there is squatting a plate more than you. Suck it up! It doesn't matter. If you look at others, use them as inspiration. Maybe you will never be as strong as that person you follow on Social Media, but you can still be much stronger or faster or what not than you were yesterday. And that's all that matters. That and the fun you'll have along the way.

Don't worry about what others think about you when you are exercising in a public place like a gym. I bet what you think others are thinking is most of the time way more negative than what they are actually thinking. If they are thinking anything about you at all. A majority of the other people at the gym is probably just in their own zone, doing their own thing, not paying any attention to you. If people do notice you, chances are that most of them see you as one of them. They are there to work out, so are you. Nothing to be worried about. As to the few ones that are indeed thinking or saying bad stuff about you (because, yeah, black sheep tend to pop up in all places): haters gonna hate. And that's all that needs to be said.

Don't listen to the others (unless it is somebody knowledgeable who is actually giving you good advice). I am talking about so-called friends or family members who are behaving like lobsters that pull the one that is about to climb out back into the pot. Backhanded compliments or comments about your physical changes. Criticism of your diet. Or even straight out rude statements like: "Uhhh, that is too much muscle! Gross!" Let them talk. If exercising is not for them... so be it. You are on a path to a healthier future. Nothing to be ashamed of.  


# Bonus tip for parents  

This is the same bonus tip as in my start [coding post](https://connie.codes/post/start_coding). Don't feel guilty about the time that you dedicate to your workouts! it is okay to take some ME TIME and to take care of yourself. You are also setting a good example for your children. If they grow up seeing you exercising and making health a priority, that kind of thing  will be just normal to them and they will be more likely to adopt those healthy habits for themselves (unless they are teenagers and rebelling against you).
